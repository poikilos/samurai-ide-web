      <h1>How to Contribute with Ninja-IDE</h1>
      <div class="sub-section-contrib">
        <p>Following the double dragon philosophy we provide you with a double chance of helping in the development of Ninja-IDE.</p>

        <h2>Help with our finances</h2>

        <p>That's right, you can have the privilege of saying: "hey, random-coding-partner-that-I-try-to-ignore-at-work-every-time-I-can-but-we-are-both-now-stucked-in-this-elevator, did you know that THIS Ninja-IDE feature exists because of me? Yes, I donated ONE TRILLION DOLLARS to the cause and I'm feeling awesome".</p>

        <p>Well, for getting you to that situation (we'll forget the elevator step for now), we give you 2 options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Donation via <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a> or <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a>. It's easy, just click on any of the buttons in the footer of this page. <a href="#huge_donation_button">Get me there now!</a>
          </li>

          <li>
            Buying some of our custom designs available in <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/ninja-ide">the Zazzle store</a>. Buying our stuff there, you get an excellent Ninja-IDE customized product AND you are helping Ninja-IDE with a percentage of the purchase. Double ninja-win!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Help with the code</h2>
        <p>As with any open source project, there are several ways you can help:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ninja-ide/topics">mailing list</a>
            and answer other user's questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Report bugs, feature requests and other issues in the
            <a href="https://github.com/ninja-ide/ninja-ide/issues">issue tracking</a> system.
          </li>
          <li>Submit patches to reported issues (both those you find, or that others have filed)</li>
          <li>
            Help with the documentation by pointing out areas that are lacking or unclear, and if you are
            so inclined, submitting patches to correct it. You can quickly contribute rough thoughts to the
            <a href="https://github.com/ninja-ide/ninja-ide/wiki/Dojo">wiki</a>,
            or you can volunteer to help collate and organize information that is already there.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can impress your friends with an awesome <b>Ninja-IDE T-Shirt</b> or any other of our excellent Ninja products brought to you by <a href="http://www.zazzle.com" target="_blank">Zazzle</a>.
