        <h3>Why are we doing NINJA-IDE?</h3>

        <p><b>NINJA-IDE</b> started as a project focused at providing an IDE specially designed for Python Applications Development,
        with this scope in mind, we put our ninja-skills into the development of a <b>free</b> and <b>open source</b> project which grows
        based on the community's necessities.</p>
        <p>Basically we want to explore and find new features that would improve the performance of any Python Developer,
        always maintaining <b>NINJA-IDE</b> fast and lightweight for anyone to use it, and compete with the current commercial IDEs out
        there, and when we say "compete" we mean: to demonstrate that you can have a beautiful application with the most popular
        features, plus the ones that the ninja-team researches and implements, without the need to pay for any license or use a
        product where you can't play with the source code.</p>

        <h3>How it was born</h3>
        <p>Buy a beer/coffee to any (or the whole bunch of!) us and we'll be glad to tell the story :)</p>
        <p>And if you don't wanna hear it, assure yourself of we keeping the secret by donating 10 million dollars.</p>
